<p><b>Archangel Airsoft basic rules and information.  Please read everything below to be prepared for your first day at Power Ops.</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Fill out the digital waiver online in advance</b></p>
<p><b>2.  Read the rules below</b></p>
<p><b>3.  Prepare to have fun with proper safety gear, clothing, and airsoft guns under the required FPS limits.</b></p>
<p><b>4.  Have fun!</b></p>

<p><b><u>Liability Waiver</u></b> - Click the link in the menu above and fill out prior to arriving. Parent of participants under 18 years of age must sign.  Waivers are also available at the field to sign if you don't sign one in advance.</p>

<p><b>WHAT TO BRING:</b>  Barrel Sock, Full seal eye protection,  and other optional safety gear (gloves, shemagh, neck protection, helmet, lower mesh mask, etc).  See below for details.  Rental packages include the essentials.  Barrel socks, eye protection, and BIO BBs are available for purchase at the field shop. </p>

<p><b><u>***Field BIO BBs only.</u></b>  Due to environmental concerns, outside BBs are not allowed to be used at Archangel Airsoft.  An assortment of popular styles and brands of authorized BIO/eco-friendly BBs will be available for purchase at our pro shop.  Plastic and HPA brand BBs are banned and not allowed to be used. </p>

<p><b><u>GENERAL AIRSOFT RULES and FAQ:</u></b></p>
<p><b>AGE LIMITS: </b></p>
<p>Minimum age is 12+ w/adult present.  It's 14+ if an adult does a drop-off.  We are generally an adult only field, so kids are the exception here.  We don't allow kids under the age of 12 due to the nature of our gameplay. </p>

<p><b>BB AMMO:</b> We require BIO BBs only. No plastic allowed. Bio ammo is available for sale at the field's shop.  HPA (High Power Airsoft brand) "bio" BBs are not allowed for use at Power Ops due to environmental concerns.  Attempting to use HPA and non-bio plastic BBs at our facility is not allowed. </p>

<p><b>STAGING AREA:</b> Barrel socks are required on weapons at all times while off the field (available for purchase at the field if you do not have one).  Do not fire a gun in the staging area or parking lot. Only discharge in designated firing areas (field and chrono station).  A barrel sock must have paracord or other restraints and must safely stop full-auto BBs.  A "sock" you put on your foot or other stupid stuff is not allowed to be used as a "barrel sock".  HPA guns must have barrel socks to keep everything uniform.  Gas pistols must be holstered or magazines removed in staging (no barrel sock for pistols required).  When in doubt, ask our refs. </p>
 
<p><b>THE FIELD:</b> Do not move any of the obstacles on the field for any reason. Do not go inside the vehicles unless staff designates you to.  Do not shoot in the parking lot. Do not shoot the overhead lighting or power lines. </p>
<p>When leaving the field and returning to staging area: </p>
<p>1. Remove your magazine</p>
<p>2. Fire/clear your barrel of BBs</p>
<p>3. Put gun on 'safe mode'</p>
<p>4. Install barrel sock</p>
 
<p><b>CALLING HITS/HONOR SYSTEM:</b> Players must call their hits. Players are required to self-police themselves when they get hit by BBs. Hits on any part of your body, mask, gear, vest, holster, helmet, etc. count as a HIT. Gun hits do not count. Ricochets do not count. Failure to call your hits will result in a warning; repeated warnings will result and expulsion from the game without refund. </p>
 
<p><b>EYE WEAR:</b> Full seal eye protection goggles (ANSI rated lensed) are required, along with full-face protection for players under the age of 18. Shooting glasses are not allowed.   Mesh eyewear is not allowed.  Sub-standard eyewear and glasses are not allowed at our discretion.  Never remove eye protection while on the playing field. Mesh lower mouth masks are allowed (and recommended) with accompanying full-seal eyewear goggles.  Full face and head protection is highly recommended for use at our field. Paintball masks are also recommended. </p>

<p><b>SAFETY:</b> Player safety is paramount. Never overshoot players or purposely aim at players to cause injury/pain. Do not shoot players that have declared themselves dead. Threatening or aggressive players will be asked to leave. No real weapons, knives, melee, guns, etc. allowed on the field or in the staging area. </p>
 
<p>NO MINIMUM ENGAGEMENT DISTANCE. EXCEPT DMRs AND SNIPERS. </p>
<p> THERE ARE NO SURRENDER RULES. SURRENDER IS OPTIONAL. </p>
 <p>NO BLIND FIRING. ALWAYS USE YOUR SIGHTS. </p>
<p>DEAD MEN DO NOT TALK. IF YOU ARE DEAD, DO NOT REVEAL THE ENEMY'S POSITION TO YOUR TEAMMATES. </p>

<p><b>WEAPON RULES:</b>
<p>MED:  There's no MED (Minimum Engagement Distance) at our field.  The only exceptions are Sniper, DMR, and the 40 Mike (30 foot MED) which are explained below. </p>
<p>FULL AUTO: Full-auto shooting is allowed on the <b>outdoor field</b>, outside of buildings. Muzzle MUST be outside building to be deemed safe for full auto. Semi-Auto only inside buildings, SAW’s and DMR’s/Snipers must swap out with sidearm when inside buildings. Also, certain game scenarios may restrict this rule.  Never overshoot anyone on full auto, especially at close range. </p>
<p>FPS VELOCITY RULES - PLEASE READ: </p>
<p> FPS LIMIT:  359 FPS (.25g). 1.50 Joule limit. (401 FPS w/.20g BBs) for all guns unless stated below: </p>
<p> DMR: 366-460 FPS (.25g) with MED of 50 feet. 2.5 Joule limit. Semi-auto only rifles. </p>
<p> SNIPER RIFLES: 460-550 FPS (.25g) with MED of 100 feet. 3.5 Joule limit. Sidearm (or AEGs) required as a backup. Snipers will be briefed on rules when you arrive at our field during chrono testing. HPA Snipers must consult with ref and chrono station before use and MED brief with a 2.9 Joule limit. </p>
<p>SMG CLASS: 300 FPS (.25g) full auto, max 25 FPS.  Midcaps only. For specialty games. Otherwise use the FPS limit above. </p>
<p>CO2 GUNS: Allowed if within FPS limit, but we ask that you pick up empty metal cartridges on the field. </p>
<p>HPA: Required to have tournament lock installed when chronoing rifle. If your HPA gun does not have a tournament lock, we will set its FPS and "lock" it with tamper tape.  You cannot adjust or remove the tape after it is set.  If you need to adjust it, please see a ref or chrono station to reset it.  HPA guns that have been tampered with or cranked up may be banned for the rest of the day.  HPA guns are to be set at 1.4 Joules limit.  If you have a HPA gun, be respectful, and don't be a dick with it.  If you suspect joule creep (higher FPS), let our refs know so we can safely address the issue. </p> 

<p>Guns that fail the chrono station will be documented, and removed from the field/staging area. Players that sneak untested guns onto the field, and shoot higher than the Joules limit, will be banned from the field and possibly fined for safety damages.  Please report to a ref any guns suspected of shooting above the FPS limit.  We will spot-chrono or test them after the game. </p>

<p><b>GRENADES, SMOKE, THROWN DEVICES:</b></p>
<p><b><u>Grenades and other pyrotechnics are only allowed on the OUTDOOR FIELD, SMOKE OR PYROTECHNICS are NOT allowed for use on the INDOOR FIELD.</u></b></p>

If a player successfully makes contact with another player using a training knife the contacted player is hit. Training knives may be NO LONGER than 12 inches. Nerf swords/axes are not allowed. Be respectful with the melee rules and not overly aggressive. </p>
